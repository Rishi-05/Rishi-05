# Hi, I'm Rishi Chliveri
I'm an AI/ML enthusiast and Backend Developer from India,
currently pursuing my B.Tech at Bharati Vidyapeeth .
I build intelligent and scalable applications that solve real-world problems â€”
from crop recommendation engines to QR-based document security systems, and even reminder bots using Telegram and Django.
I'm passionate about using machine learning and backend systems to drive innovation, with hands-on experience across Python, Django, Flask, and deep learning frameworks.
